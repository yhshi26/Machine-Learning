Machine learning:
  - A collection of techniques for extracting information from data
    e.g. analyzing credit card history to detect fraud
    
    Classification: sorting an observation in a discrete class
    Model: mathematical algorithm that processes data into an output class (classification)
      - Machine learning builds the model from data (rather than the programmer manually coding the model)
    
    Classification flow:
      - Import data
      - Preprocess (clean up the data)
      - Extract features
      - Build model (using information extracted)
      - Evaluate model
